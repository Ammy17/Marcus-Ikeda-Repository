1. Length and Width are strongly correlated with each other but why is there a weak correlation with both of those and Height?
There is quite an extreme outlier in the height dataset and once that outlier is removed, we have a more normal distribution of results between the height and

2. USB Ports are correlated with super weird things (length 0.98 / city_milage_km -0.95 /airbags 0.91

The USB Ports just happened to conincidentally show strong correlations with some of the other fields. This is because of a lot data points overlapping due to the models of the cars being the same which causes high correlation since there is already a very small number of data points which is further compounded by the fact that the data points are already in the same place.

3. Seating Capacity is only correlated with height while boot space capacity has a slight negative correltion

Maybe we need to look at the percentage of the potential volume the car takes up?
They do not have a correlation at all

4. Fuel Tank capacity is correlated with lenght/width but inversely correlated with mileage?
What gives us the most mileage?
Engine Location seems to be important for detemining milage as well as the body type of the car.

5. How does the wheel size affect the mileage of the car?

6. What is minimum turning radius and what makes it big or small?
